    <p>n June 2016, Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for The Avengers (2012), was revealed to be returning to score both Infinity War and Endgame.[124] Silvestri recorded his score from January 2018[125] to late March, and found working on the film to be "a really different experience than anything I'd done before, especially in regard to the approach and balancing quick shifts in tone".[126] Ludwig GÃ¶ransson's theme from Black Panther is used in the film.[127] Hollywood Records and Marvel Music released regular and deluxe soundtrack albums digitally on April 27, 2018, with physical releases on May 18. The deluxe edition featured some extended and additional tracks.[128]</p><br /> <hr />
