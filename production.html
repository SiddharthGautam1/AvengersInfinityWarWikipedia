    <p>In October 2014, Marvel announced a two-part sequel to Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), titled Avengers: Infinity War. Part 1 was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, with Part 2 scheduled for May 3, 2019.[93][94] In April 2015, Marvel announced that Anthony and Joe Russo would direct both parts of Avengers: Infinity War,[95] with back-to-back filming expected to begin in 2016.[96] The next month, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely had signed on to write the screenplays for both parts of the film,[97] which draws inspiration from Jim Starlin's 1991 The Infinity Gauntlet comic and Jonathan Hickman's 2013 Infinity comic.[98] Anthony Russo added the film was inspired by 1990s heist films, with Thanos "on a smash-and-grab [to acquire the Infinity Stones], and everybody's trying to catch up the whole movie".[58] Producer Kevin Feige said that the Infinity War films were subtitled Part 1 and Part 2 "because they [have] such shared elements, it felt appropriate... But I wouldn't call it one story that's cut in half. I would say it's going to be two distinct movies".[99] In May 2016, the Russos revealed that they would retitle the two films, to further remove the misconception that they were one large film split in two, with Joe stating, "The intention is we will change [the titles], we just haven't come up with [them] yet".[100] That July, Marvel revealed Part 1's title would be shortened to simply Avengers: Infinity War.</p>
