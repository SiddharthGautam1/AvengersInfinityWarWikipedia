    <h1>Cast of Avengers : Infinity War</h1>
    <br />
    <hr />
    <p>Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:
        The leader and benefactor of the Avengers who is a self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with electromechanical suits of armor of his own making.[7][8] Co-director Joe Russo explained that Stark "senses this greater threat approaching, so he is doing everything in his power to keep the Earth safe".[9] Downey added that Stark has smaller goals than in previous films.[10]<br /> <br /> <br /> 
        Chris Hemsworth as Thor:
        An Avenger and the king of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[11] Joe Russo stated that Thor's storyline picks up after the events of Thor: Ragnarok (2017), which finds him in a "very profound... very interesting place" with "real emotional motivation".[12] At the recommendation of Hemsworth, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely consulted Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi and screenwriter Eric Pearson to help carry over the comedic and tragic elements of the re-toned Thor from that film.[13] Joe Russo said that Thor has "the driving hero's arc of the movie which stands in direct opposition to Thanos' argument" and would have been the main protagonist of the film had Thor killed Thanos.[14]<br /> <br /> <br />
        Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk:
        An Avenger and genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, typically transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated.[15][16] Banner spends the film trying to reintegrate with the Avengers and "impress upon everybody how dangerous Thanos is".[17] Joe Russo felt the Hulk refusing to appear for much of the film was only partially because he was scared, but also because he realizes that "Banner only wants Hulk for fighting. I think he's had enough of saving Banner's ass". Russo added that this was "really reflective of the journey from Ragnarok... [where] these two characters are constantly in conflict with each other over control".[18] Banner's appearance in the film continues a story arc for the character that was established in Thor: Ragnarok and concludes in Avengers: Endgame,[19] with the difference between Hulk and Banner "starting to blur a little bit". Ruffalo described Hulk in Infinity War as having the mental capacity of a five-year-old.[17] <br /> <br /> <br />  etc.
